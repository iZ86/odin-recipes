		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Sweet potato is famed for its high fibre, starchy carb, and vitamin A content. Uually nuked and eaten alongside a plain chicken breast and a pile of greens, this deliciously different recipe gives a new lease of life to the sweet potato.</p>
		<p>By adding chorizo, eggs, and chickpeas you're not only ramping up the flavour of this dish, but also the all-important protein content.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>500g sweet potatoes</li>
			<li>1 tbsp of Coconut Oil</li>
			<li>1/2 red onion (finely chopped)</li>
			<li>200g tinned chickpeas (drained)</li>
			<li>150g chroizo or pancetta (chopped into 1m cubes)</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp. sea salt</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
			<li>4 medium free-range eggs</li>
			<li>Handful pickled and sliced japapeños</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Peel the sweet potatoes and chop into 2cm cubes. Put the cubes into a pan and cover with water, then bring to the boil. Once boiling, drain and allow the steam to run off for 2-3 minutes.</li>
			<li>While waiting, add the coconut oil to a pan on a medium to high heat. Once melted, add the chopped onions and chorizo/pancetta, and fry for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
			<li>Next, turn the heat down to medium and add the sweet potatoes, chickpeas, jalapenos, sea salt and black pepper. Squash them down a little and fry for 8-10 minutes without moving them, until the bottom becomes crispy.</li>
			<li>Once crispy, make 4 small wells in the hash and break in the eggs. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2-3 minutes until the eggs are cooked but the yolk is still runny (you can cook for longer if you like your yolks well-done).</li>
			<li>Top with a few extra jalapeños and serve.</li>
		</ol>
